## Reflection

Eh, everything works.  Sort of wonder what the testing process looks like; whether it's using jest or something; whether the process could be made faster.  I'll have to ask about that sometime.

## Notes

Assignment text "Modify the “Create Note” Route: In your notes route file (routes/api/notes.js)"; instead of notes.js, noteRoutes.js.

"routes/api/noteRoutes.js ... const { Note } = require('../../models');"; instead of '../../models', '../../models/Note'

"routes/api/userRoutes.js ... const { User } = require('../../models');"; instead of '../../models', '../../models/User'

I think I updated some other references too, with routing and index and such.
